## Why Chatter — Business Value & Use Cases

* **Launch fast:** Ship a consumer-grade social product (mobile + backend) much faster than building from scratch.
* **Monetize:** Integrations for subscriptions, paid rooms, tipping and promoted posts.
* **Retention-first:** Rooms + reels + chat make the product sticky and increase daily active use.
* **White-label:** Ideal for niche communities, creator platforms, internal enterprise social tools and local social apps.

---

## Core Features

* Feed: posts with images, video, likes, comments and shares.
* Reels / Stories: short-form video + music integration and composer UI.
* Rooms: audio/text rooms with hosts, listeners, and moderation controls.
* Real-time chat: 1:1 and group messaging with read receipts and typing indicators.
* Profiles & Follow system, user verification badge UI.
* Notifications: push & in-app notifications for mentions, messages and follows.
* Media uploads with CDN-ready URLs and placeholder/preview flows.
* Admin panel (Laravel) for moderation, content takedown, analytics and user management.
* OAuth logins: Google, Apple, Email; optional phone/SMS auth.

---

## Tech Stack & Architecture

**Frontend**

* Flutter (Dart) mobile app (supports iOS & Android).
* State management: Provider / Bloc / Riverpod (template variant dependent).
* Navigation: Flutter Navigator 2.0 or stable Navigator + bottom/tab layout.

**Backend**

* Laravel (PHP) REST API + Sanctum / Passport for auth.
* Database: MySQL / PostgreSQL.
* Storage: S3-compatible storage (images & videos).
* Realtime: Laravel Echo + Pusher or Socket.IO (Node) gateway.
* Media processing: background workers (Laravel Queues + Redis) for video encoding, thumbnails.

**Optional**

* Microservices for heavy-media workflows (transcoding).
* Separate RTC (WebRTC) service for audio rooms at scale.

## Quickstart — Run Locally (Dev)

> High-level steps — adapt to your repo layout.

### Backend (Laravel)

```bash
# clone and install
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatter-backend.git
cd chatter-backend
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
# set DB credentials in .env
php artisan migrate --seed
php artisan storage:link
php artisan serve
```

### Frontend (Flutter)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatter-flutter.git
cd chatter-flutter
cp .env.example .env        # if using flutter_dotenv
flutter pub get
# run on simulator / device
flutter run
```

### Realtime & Queues

* Start Redis for queues and broadcasting.
* Start queue worker:

```bash
php artisan queue:work --tries=3
```

* Configure Pusher / Socket server credentials in `.env`.

---

## Environment & Secrets (example)

Backend `.env` minimal:

```
APP_URL=https://api.example.com
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_DATABASE=chatter
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
BROADCAST_DRIVER=pusher
PUSHER_APP_ID=xxx
PUSHER_APP_KEY=xxx
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=xxx
FILESYSTEM_DRIVER=s3
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx
AWS_BUCKET=chatter-media
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
```

Flutter `.env` minimal (or use config constants):

```
API_BASE=https://api.example.com
PUSHER_KEY=xxx
SENTRY_DSN=xxx
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=xxx
STRIPE_KEY=pk_test_xxx
```

---

## API / Data Model (high level)

**Key endpoints (examples)**:

```
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/register
GET  /api/feed?page=1
POST /api/posts
GET  /api/posts/{id}
POST /api/posts/{id}/like
POST /api/rooms
GET  /api/rooms/{id}/members
POST /api/rooms/{id}/join
GET  /api/users/{id}
POST /api/messages
```

**Simplified models**:

* `User` { id, name, username, bio, avatar, verified }
* `Post` { id, user_id, type, media[], text, likes_count, comments_count }
* `Room` { id, title, host_id, visibility, status }
* `Message` { id, room_id | convo_id, sender_id, body, attachments, status }
* `Media` { id, url, type, thumbnail_url, duration }

---

## Realtime & Media Considerations

* **Chat**: use Pusher / Ably / Socket cluster for message pub/sub and presence. For scale consider self-hosted Socket.IO with Redis adapter.
* **Audio Rooms**: for >100 concurrent participants use a media server (Jitsi/VicRTC or a dedicated SFU like Janus / mediasoup).
* **Video / Reels**: process uploads via background workers, transcode to multiple bitrates, store on CDN (S3 + CloudFront). Generate thumbnails for feed.
* **Push Notifications**: FCM for Android, APNs for iOS (via Laravel notifications).

---

## Admin / Moderation / Monetization Plan

**Admin Panel (Laravel Nova / custom)**:

* User management: ban, mute, verify.
* Content moderation: remove posts, remove media, shadowban.
* Reports queue: user reports with severity and action history.
* Payments & commerce: manage payouts, monitor revenue.

**Monetization models**:

* Subscriptions: premium features, ad-free feed.
* Paid rooms / events: charge entry fee.
* Tips & gifts: Stripe / in-app purchases.
* Sponsored posts & promoted discoverability.

---

## Performance, Security & Privacy Checklist

* Use HTTPS and HSTS; enforce secure cookies.
* Sanitize inputs and escape outputs (prevent XSS).
* Rate-limit public endpoints and protect message endpoints.
* Use JWT / Laravel Sanctum with refresh tokens; rotate secrets.
* Store media in S3 behind signed URLs when necessary.
* GDPR: implement user data export and deletion endpoints.
* Monitor with Sentry + performance tracing; set alerts on errors and queue backpressure.

---

## Analytics & KPIs to Measure ROI

* DAU / MAU and stickiness (DAU/MAU ratio).
* Retention cohorts (day-1, day-7, day-30).
* Time-in-app per session (rooms vs feed).
* Conversion rates: install → register → first post → paid conversion.
* Engagement metrics: messages per user, posts per user, avg listeners per room.

---

## Deployment & CI/CD Recommendations

* **CI**: GitHub Actions to run tests, lint PHP/JS/Dart, run asset builds and build Android / iOS artifacts.
* **CD**:

  * Backend: Docker image → deploy to ECS / DigitalOcean / Render; use RDS/managed DB + ElastiCache Redis.
  * Frontend: publish Flutter builds via Fastlane to TestFlight / Play Console; use EAS if Expo.
  * Use managed services for scaling (S3 + CDN, Pusher/Ably or self-hosted socket infra).

Example pipeline:

1. Push → run PHPUnit / PHPStan / PHP-CS-Fixer.
2. Build frontend tests (Dart analyzer, unit tests).
3. Build backend Docker image, push to registry.
4. Deploy to staging and run smoke tests.
5. Promote to production.
